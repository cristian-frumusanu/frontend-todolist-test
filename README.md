# The Classic To-Do Frontend App 

The purpose is to create an ToDo list WebApp that will permit the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
The point it to see how you code and how you organise your code, your coding style, how you commit, etc.

## Requirements
- no design requirement, improvise ðŸ™ƒ;
- create the WebApp using your Frontend framework of choice, bonus points for using Vue.js (2.x because that's what we're using on our product);
- for storage, use the browser's `Window.localStorage`; if the user clears the browser cache, the data will be lost, we're happy with that;
- make it look pretty also on small/mobile devices;
- for the styles, use SCSS; if you need, use a CSS library, bonus points for using Tailwind.CSS;
- you don't need to have it up and running online but make sure that we'll be able to run it locally on our devices;

## Deadline
Thursday 13th of April 2023 at 12:00PM. But whenever you're done, let us know.

## Liberties
- you can use whatever tool help you would use on a daily basis, search engines, StackOverflow, documentations of the frameworks, etc. I advise against using ChatGPT or similar;
- you can create issues & PRs on this repo if it helps you organise yourself. We won't be looking at the PRs but at the final product. Joking, we'll be looking at everything.

Break a leg!
